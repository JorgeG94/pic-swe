# Simple dam break 

This is just a learning exercise for me to see how to optimize this code. 

## Building 

The code is built using the [Fortran package manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) which 
can be installed following the [instructions here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html). 

Once the FPM is installed, simply do: `fpm build` and to run `fpm run` 

## Visualizing your simulation 

The code will dump CSVs that detail the dam breaking, you can plot them using the visualize.py script
